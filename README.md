Pay and allowance disbursement and Income Tax deduction system

>The current version is 2017-18 release 5

The Microsoft Office based software (Access database plus Excel templates for data import and documentation in Word) helps Drawing and Disbursing Office (DDO) to disburse Salary as well as other allowances while calculating and deducting Income Tax from individuals at source as mandated by Income Tax Rules in India.

The package was designed for Border Security Force and is now being maintained by me as open source so that any organisation using distributed DDO system can reap benefits out of this.

Since the rules of tax are same for all salaried persons, the database can be utilised across the departments, however, depending upon the difference in salary data import procedure, changes may be required in the system.

File updates could be seen while looking at the list on the site itself.

## Requirements
